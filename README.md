# I Need Bodies

[![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/InsultingPros/INeedBodies/total)](https://github.com/InsultingPros/INeedBodies/releases)

Allows zed corpses to stay longer. In comparison to 1060 version

* Husks were added.
* Fixed invisible zeds after switching game to vanilla. Thanks to [Scary Ghost](https://github.com/scaryghost/SuperZombieMut/blob/master/Classes/SuperZombieMut.uc).

> N.B. I do not plan to optimize this for dedicated servers / add other features. Fork this or create a PR.
